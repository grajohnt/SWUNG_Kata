      "You have a string of lithology codes, reading from the **bottom up** of a geological section. There is a sample every metre. There are three lithologies:\n",

      "\n",
      "1. What is the total thickess in metres of sandstone (`S`)? Each sample represents one metre.\n",
      "2. How many sandstone beds are there? A bed is a contiguous group of one lithology, so `MMFFF` is 2 beds, one of `M` and one of `F`.\n",
      "3. How many times does the most common *upwards* bed transition occur? Do not include transitions from a lithology to itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that the sequence is given to you from the bottom up. So an upwards transition is equivalent to a transition to the right.\n",

      "- There are 6 sandstone beds in the sequence (marked above). The answer is: **6**\n",

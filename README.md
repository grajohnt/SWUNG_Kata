# SWUNG Kata Challenges - Solutions

Although late to the game, I'm in the process of working through the [Software Underground's "Kata" challenges](https://gist.github.com/kwinkunks/50f11dac6ab7ff8c3e6c7b34536501a2). These are a series of challenges in geocomputing to sharpen skills.

I have written mine in Python, but any language would do. I have made no special attempts to make things super-concise, as I generally lean towards readability. I've commented so it's possible to understand what I've done, but if there's any confusion, just ask!
